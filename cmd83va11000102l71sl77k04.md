In this article, we will explore the basics of Terraform, its key concepts, and how to get started writing your very first Terraform code to provision infrastructure. If you are following this series, make sure to keep a folder ready on your system and install Terraform (we’ll cover it below!).

Earlier in the series, we touched upon Helm basics. However, to build a stronger foundation in infrastructure provisioning, we’ll now pause the Helm series and dive deep into Terraform for the next few days.Once we’ve covered the core and advanced Terraform concepts, I’ll resume the Helm series with much more clarity, as the concepts from Terraform will help us better understand Helm Charts and Kubernetes deployments.

## What is Terraform?

Terraform is an open-source tool developed by HashiCorp that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level declarative configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).

Unlike manual setup using AWS Console or CLI, Terraform lets you declare infrastructure as code (IaC), making deployments automated, versioned, and reproducible.

## Why Use Terraform?

Let’s understand with real-world analogies:

<mark>Without Terraform:</mark> You log into AWS and manually launch EC2 instances, set up networking, and manage configurations.

<mark>With Terraform</mark>: You write a .tf file to define everything. Just run terraform apply, and your infrastructure is automatically created.

### Installing Terraform :

**Windows/macOS/Linux:**

Visit : [https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)

**Debian/Ubuntu:**

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common curl
curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-add-repository "deb https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install terraform
```

**Check Version**:

```bash
terraform -version
```

**Terraform Folder Structure (Best Practice):**

Here's how a simple project structure looks:

```bash
terraform-ec2/
├── main.tf          # Core infrastructure code
├── variables.tf     # Variables (inputs)
├── outputs.tf       # Output definitions
├── provider.tf      # Provider setup (e.g., AWS)
└── terraform.tfvars # Actual variable values
```

## Core Terraform Concepts :

Let’s break down the main building blocks:

1\. **Provider :**

Specifies the cloud or platform you are working with.

```bash
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```

2\. **Resource :**

A block that defines what you want to create.

**Example**: An EC2 instance

```bash
resource "aws_instance" "demo" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

3\. **Variable :**

Used to parameterize values.

```bash
variable "region" {
  default = "us-east-1"
}
```

4\. **Output :**

Used to print or export values after deployment.

```bash
output "public_ip" {
```

5\. **State :**

Terraform keeps track of infrastructure using a `.tfstate` file. It records what has been created and ensures the next deployment is consistent.

### Day 1 Hands-on: Launching an EC2 Instance on AWS :-

**Step 1: Create a main.tf file :**

Let’s create a basic EC2 instance in AWS:

```bash
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "Day40TerraformInstance"
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Initialize Terraform :**

```bash
terraform init
```

This will download the AWS provider plugin.

**Step 3: Validate the Code :**

```bash
terraform validate
```

**Step 4: See What Will Be Created :**

```bash
terraform plan
```

This gives a preview of what Terraform will do.

**Step 5: Apply the Configuration :**

```bash
terraform apply
```

Type yes to confirm. Terraform will now create the EC2 instance.

**Step 6: Destroy the Infrastructure :**

To avoid charges in AWS:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Type yes to destroy all resources created by Terraform.

**Pro Tips for Beginners :**

* Use Visual Studio Code with the Terraform plugin for syntax highlighting.
    
* Always keep your .tfstate file safe — treat it like your infrastructure "database."
    
* Use terraform fmt to format your code automatically.
    
* Prefer terraform plan before apply to avoid surprises.
