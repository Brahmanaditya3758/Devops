Today, we’re diving into a very important Kubernetes concept — Namespaces, Resource Limits, and Requests. These concepts help in organizing, managing, and optimizing resource allocation in a Kubernetes cluster — crucial for ensuring multi-team collaboration, cost efficiency, and system reliability.

## What Are Kubernetes Namespaces?

Namespaces in Kubernetes provide logical isolation between environments and applications. Think of them as separate rooms in the same house — you can keep things organized and independent.

### Why Use Namespaces?

* You want multiple teams working on the same cluster.
    
* You need to separate environments: `dev`, `staging`, `production`.
    
* You want to enforce resource constraints per team/project.
    

### Creating a Namespace

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: dev
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f dev-namespace.yaml
```

Or directly via CLI:

```bash
kubectl create namespace dev
```

## How to Use Namespaces

### Switching Between Namespaces:

```bash
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=dev
```

### Creating Resources Within a Namespace:

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx -n dev
```

## Requests and Limits in Kubernetes

Kubernetes allows you to control CPU and Memory for Pods using Requests and Limits.

| Resource | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `requests` | Minimum resource guarantee | Scheduler uses this to place pods |
| `limits` | Maximum resource cap | Container cannot exceed this |

### Example: CPU/Memory Request & Limit in Pod :

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: limited-nginx
  namespace: dev
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
```

## Why Requests and Limits Matter

* **Avoid resource starvation** — ensures everyone gets their fair share.
    
* **Stability** — no one pod hogs the node’s resources.
    
* **Predictability** — allows better scheduling and autoscaling.
    
* **Cost Optimization** — avoids over-provisioning in cloud environments.
    

## ResourceQuota for Namespaces

You can enforce policies for each namespace using a `ResourceQuota`. This ensures that even collectively, pods can’t exceed certain boundaries.

### Sample ResourceQuota:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: dev-quota
  namespace: dev
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "10"
    requests.cpu: "2"
    requests.memory: "4Gi"
    limits.cpu: "4"
    limits.memory: "8Gi"
```

This limits:

* A maximum of 10 pods
    
* 2 CPUs & 4Gi memory for requests
    
* 4 CPUs & 8Gi memory for limits
    

## Real-World DevOps Scenario :

Let’s say We’re working on a shared Kubernetes cluster used by:

* Team A (Namespace: `dev`)
    
* Team B (Namespace: `prod`)
    

We want to ensure:

* Team A doesn’t consume more than 20% of total cluster CPU.
    
* Each pod by Team A can only use max 500m CPU and 256Mi memory.
    

We’d use:

* Namespace `dev` for Team A.
    
* ResourceQuota for namespace-wide caps.
    
* Requests and Limits in Pod definitions.
