Yo, *bhai log* ! Welcome back to my 90 Days of DevOps journey! 😎 I’ve been grinding through DevOps tools like a true *desi* coder, and as of Day 43, I’ve tackled a ton of cool stuff. Now, starting Day 44, I’m leveling up with a *bhasad-level* project that’s gonna be my college major project *aur* a ticket to impress future employers in DevOps and cloud fields. Grab your *chai*, let’s dive into what I’ve learned, what I’m building next, and my big plans post-90 days! 🥳

## Days 1 – 43 Recap :-

So far, this journey has been like learning to cook *biryani*—step-by-step, with a mix of spicy tools and techniques! Here’s the *masala* I’ve covered:

* **Linux Commands**: From `ls` **to** `grep`, I’m navigating the terminal like a *pro* (okay, maybe a *pro-in-training*). Think of it as finding your way in a crowded *bazaar*!
    
* **Git & GitHub**: Version control is my *dost* now—branching, merging, and pushing code like it’s *WhatsApp* forwards.
    
* **Docker**: Containerized apps like packing *dabba* for lunch—neat and portable!
    
* **CI/CD with jenkins** : Automated pipelines that build and test my code faster than *mummy* making *parathas*.
    
* **AWS Basics**: Played with EC2, S3, and CloudWatch in the free tier—cloud feels like my *baap ka ghar* now!
    
* **Terraform**: Writing infrastructure as code is like scripting a Bollywood movie—everything in place!
    
* **Jenkins**: Set up pipelines like a *traffic cop* directing code to production.
    

I’ve got the *theory* down (thanks to college notes), but now it’s time to get my hands dirty with a real project. Let’s talk about the *dhamaka* I’m building next!

## Day 44–90: The College Event & Resource Management System

From Day 44, I’m diving into a full-stack web app that’s gonna make my college’s life easier. Say hello to the **College Event and Resource Management System**! This app will let students and faculty manage events (like fests or seminars), book resources (like projectors or labs), and post announcements. Admins can approve stuff and check reports, making it a *game-changer* for campus chaos. Plus, it’s my college major project, so it’s gotta be *jhakaas*!

### Why This Project?

* **College Love**: No more manual scheduling or fighting over lab bookings—my app will sort it like a *pandit* fixing *muhurat*.
    
* **DevOps Skills**: I’ll use my theoretical knowledge of Docker, CI/CD, and cloud to automate and deploy like a boss.
    
* **Backend Learning**: I’m new to backend, so I’ll build APIs to handle data—perfect for leveling up my skills.
    
* **Job Prep**: This screams “hire me” for DevOps/cloud roles with its pipelines and AWS deployment.
    

### What’s the Plan?

Here’s how I’m breaking it down for Days 44–90 (about 7 weeks):

* **Days 44 – 50: Backend Basics with Node.js & Express :**
    
    * Set up a server with Express.js to create APIs (e.g., /events for listing seminars).
        
    * Use MongoDB to store events, bookings, and users—think of it as a *digital register*.
        
    * Test APIs with Postman to make sure they’re *sahi hai*.
        
    * *Why?* Node.js uses JavaScript, which I know from frontend, so it’s less *jalebi* for my brain.
        
* **Days 51 – 60: Add Authentication & Features :**
    
    * Add login/signup with JWT tokens—only legit users get in, like a *college ID check*.
        
    * Build APIs for booking resources (no double-booking labs!) and sending email notifications with Nodemailer.
        
    * Learn async JavaScript to handle database queries smoothly. *No tension, only action!* 📧
        
* **Days 61 – 70: Frontend with React :**
    
    * Start with HTML/CSS/JS (my comfort zone), then shift to React for cool components like an event calendar.
        
    * Use Axios to connect frontend to backend APIs—think of it as *chai* meeting *biscuit*.
        
    * Add a dashboard for admins to approve bookings or see reports. *Fancy, na?*
        
* **Days 71 – 80: DevOps Magic :**
    
    * Containerize with Docker—backend and frontend in separate containers, like *thali* compartments.
        
    * Set up a GitHub Actions pipeline to build, test, and deploy automatically. *Code push kiya, aur ho gaya!*
        
    * Use Terraform to script AWS resources (like EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk). *Infra banega code se!*
        
* **Days 81 – 90: Cloud Deployment & Polish :**
    
    * Deploy on AWS (free tier) with S3 for files (e.g., event posters) and CloudWatch for monitoring.
        
    * Add bells and whistles: PDF reports, mobile-friendly UI, maybe a calendar sync.
        
    * Write a *solid* project report for college with diagrams and a demo video. *Full marks loading!*
        

### Tech Stack Breakdown :-

* **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JS → React.js (for dynamic calendar and forms).
    
* **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB (easy to learn, scalable).
    
* **DevOps/Cloud**: Docker, GitHub Actions, Terraform, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, S3, Lambda for notifications).
    
* **Extras**: Nodemailer for emails, Chart.js for dashboards, Cypress for testing.
    

### How I’ll Share Progress :-

* **Weekly Blogs**: Each week, I’ll drop updates on my Hashnode blog—what I built, what broke, and how I fixed it. *Dil se dil tak!*
    
* **LinkedIn Posts**: Quick snippets with screenshots or code snippets to show off my *kaam*. Follow me there!
    
* **GitHub Repo**: All code will be public—check my progress and suggest improvements. *Open source vibe hai!*
    
* **College Demo**: By Day 90, I’ll show my college a working app, complete with a report and video. *Professors ko impress karenge!*
    

## Why You Should Care?

This project isn’t just for marks—it’s about solving real college problems (no more “lab booked hai!” chaos) and proving I can build production-ready apps. If you’re into DevOps, web dev, or just curious, follow along! Drop comments on my blog or LinkedIn for tips, *chai pe charcha*, or to roast my code. 😜

Stay tuned for weekly updates starting Day 44. Let’s make this *dhamakedaar*!
