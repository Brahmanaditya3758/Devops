## ***Introduction :-***

Many students learn technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, and DevOps, but very few actually build a complete real-world project from scratch.

So I decided to challenge myself:

*<mark>Build a complete College Event &amp; Resource Management System</mark>*

***This project is not only for:***

* College submission
    
* Resume
    
* Portfolio
    
* Placement interviews
    

Day 1 is fully dedicated to planning, project initialization, and setting up a clean development environment.

## **Project Overview :-**

### Project Name:

**College Event & Resource Management System**

### 👥 User Roles:

* **Student** – View & register for events.
    
* **Coordinator** – Create events & request resources.
    
* **Admin** – Approve events, manage resources & users.
    

### 🛠️ Core Features:

* Authentication (Login / Register)
    
* Role-based dashboards
    
* Event management
    
* Resource management
    
* Approval system
    

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Finalized :-

After thinking about scalability and real-world usage, I finalized this stack:

### 🌐 Frontend

* React.js.
    
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
    

### ⚙️ Backend

* Node.js.
    
* Express.js.
    

### 🗄️ Database

* MongoDB.
    

### 🔐 Authentication

* JWT (JSON Web Token).
    

### 🧰 Tools

* VS Code.
    
* Git & GitHub.
    

# **What I Did Practically on Day 1 :-**

### 1\. Created Main Project Folder :

```plaintext
college-event-system/
 ├── backend/
 └── frontend/
```

This structure keeps frontend and backend cleanly separated.

### 2\. Initialised Git Repository :

I initialised Git in the main project folder to:

* Track progress daily
    
* Maintain clean version history
    
* Prepare for GitHub & CI/CD later
    

```plaintext
git init
```

### 3\. Created README.md File :

I added a `README.md` file to describe:

* Project purpose
    
* Tech stack
    
* Basic information
    

This is important for:

* GitHub
    
* Documentation
    
* Interview explanation
    

### 4\. Added .gitignore :

To avoid unnecessary files:

```bash
node_modules
.env
dist
```

### 5\. Defined Clear Project Scope :

I clearly wrote down:

* What problem I’m solving.
    
* What features I will build.
    
* What roles will exist.
    
* How the system will work.
    

### 6\. Designed High-Level Architecture

```nginx
React Frontend  →  Node.js API  →  MongoDB Database
```

This gives a clear mental picture of the system before writing code.

## 📁 Day 1 Final Output :

By the end of Day 1, I had:

* Project folder created.
    
* backend/ and frontend/ folders created.
    
* Git initialised.
    
* README.md created.
    
* Clear roadmap of what I am going to build.

## Why Day 1 Is So Important?

❝ <mark>A strong foundation saves weeks of confusion later.</mark> ❞

Because:

* Bad structure = messy project
    
* No planning = incomplete project
    
* No Git = no professionalism

## 🏁 Conclusion :

Day 1 was about thinking like a software engineer before acting like a coder.

Instead of jumping into code, I:

* Planned the system.
    
* Structured the workspace.
    
* Prepared for a long, consistent journey.
