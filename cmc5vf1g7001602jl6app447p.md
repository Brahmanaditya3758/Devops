In our journey through Kubernetes, we’ve already explored pods, replication controllers, and services. Today, let’s dive deep into a powerful Kubernetes object that plays a vital role in managing application lifecycles: the Deployment object. We'll also understand how Kubernetes helps us to rollback in case of failure, making it a reliable platform for continuous delivery.

## What is a Kubernetes Deployment?

* A Deployment in Kubernetes is a higher-level abstraction that manages ReplicaSets and, in turn, manages Pods. It provides declarative updates to applications along with capabilities like rolling updates and rollbacks.Think of it as a way to describe the desired state for your application, and Kubernetes ensures the cluster eventually reaches that state.
    
* A deployment is an object. It's an updated version of RS and it has more facilities and power.
    
* Deployment objects act as task supervisors for pods. It won't supervise itself, but it has to supervise RS and RS control pods. So this is how deployment objects have to control over how and when a new pod is rolled out, updated or rolled back to a previous state.

* Replication Controller and Replica set is not able to do updates and rollback application.
    
    * So , Deployment object comes into Play it manages Rs and Rs manages pods.
        

## Why Use a Deployment?

* Roll out replicas of an app in a controlled manner
    
* Support for self-healing (via ReplicaSets)
    
* Enable rolling updates to prevent downtime
    
* Easy rollback to a previous version
    
* Declarative configuration (stored in version control)
    

| **Use Case** | **Command / Method** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rollout ReplicaSet | `kubectl apply -f` | Create/Manage replicas |
| Change Port/Image | Edit Deployment YAML | Apply new state |
| Rollback | `kubectl rollout undo` | Revert to stable version |
| Scale Up | `kubectl scale` | Handle high traffic |
| Pause Deployment | `kubectl rollout pause/resume` | Apply multiple changes safely |
| Clean Old RAs | `kubectl delete rs` | Free up space, reduce clutter |

## Deployment YAML Manifest Example

Here’s a sample Deployment :

```yaml
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: mydeployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: deployment
  template:
    metadata:
      name: testpod
      labels:
        name: deployment
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: c00
          image: ubuntu
          command: ["/bin/bash", "-c" "while true; do echo aditya-sharma; sleep 5; done"]
```

### Breakdown of the YAML

| **<mark>Field</mark>** | **<mark>Description</mark>** |
| --- | --- |
| `apiVersion` | Uses `apps/v1`, the current stable version for Deployments. |
| `kind` | Type of object, here it's `Deployment`. |
| `metadata` | Name and labels for identifying the Deployment. |
| `replicas` | Number of desired Pod replicas. |
| `selector` | Defines how the Deployment finds Pods to manage (must match the template labels). |
| `template` | The Pod template to create Pods. |
| `containers` | Details of container including name, image, and exposed ports. |

## Rollback Strategies in Kubernetes Deployments :-

Kubernetes provides built-in rollback mechanisms to ensure application reliability during updates.

There are two rollback types in Kubernetes:

1. Automatic Rollback (on failure)
    
2. Manual Rollback (to previous or specific revision)
    

### **1\. Automatic Rollback on Failure :**

If a rollout fails due to a crash, failed probes, or deployment errors (like a bad image), Kubernetes can automatically stop the rollout and revert to the last known good state.

This depends on the health checks (readiness/liveness probes). If your new Pods aren’t healthy, the Deployment will pause and potentially roll back.

**Can monitor this with:**

```yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment-name>
```

If the rollout fails, the system may trigger a rollback, or you can do it manually (recommended for full control).

### **2\. Manual Rollback to Previous Version :**

If you simply want to undo the most recent rollout and go back to the last stable version, use:

```yaml
kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name>
```

This will revert the Deployment to the immediately previous revision.

### **3\. Manual Rollback to a Specific Revision :**

Sometimes, you might want to roll back to a specific version instead of just the last one. Kubernetes tracks the revision history, and you can rollback to any revision number.

1. **Check Deployment History:**
    

```yaml
kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment-name>
```

2. **Rollback to Specific Revision:**
    

```yaml
kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name> --to-revision=2
```

## **Inspecting a Deployment :-**

To inspect the status of your deployments, you can run:

```yaml
kubectl get deployments
```

You'll see an output like:

```yaml
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           5m
```

### Column Breakdown

| **<mark>Column</mark>** | **<mark>Meaning</mark>** |
| --- | --- |
| **NAME** | Name of the Deployment |
| **READY** | How many Pods are running and healthy (`<ready>/<desired>`) |
| **UP-TO-DATE** | How many Pods have been updated to match the latest Deployment |
| **AVAILABLE** | How many Pods are available to serve traffic |
| **AGE** | How long the Deployment has existed |

## **Kubernetes Deployment: Essential Command Cheatsheet :-**

### 1\. Check if the Deployment Was Created :

```yaml
kubectl get deployments
```

This lists all deployments in the current namespace.

**To get a specific deployment :**

```yaml
kubectl get deployment <deployment-name>
```

**To view detailed information :**

```yaml
kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>
```

### 2\. Check ReplicaSet Created by Deployment :

```yaml
kubectl get rs
```

### 3\. Check the Pods Created by the Deployment :

```yaml
kubectl get pods
```

### 4\. Rollout Commands :

#### Check Rollout Status :

```yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment-name>
```

This shows whether the rollout is complete or still in progress.

#### View Rollout History

```yaml
kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment-name>
```

**To view a specific revision:**

```yaml
kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment-name> --revision=2
```

#### Undo the Last Deployment

```yaml
kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name>
```

#### Undo to a Specific Revision

```yaml
kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name> --to-revision=2
```
